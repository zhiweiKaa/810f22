\end{center}

Read pages 1--3 of {\em On Being a Scientist}, which is freely available from a link on the course web page, \url{https://ionides.github.io/810f22/}. Edit the tex file, available at \url{https://ionides.github.io/810f22/hw01.tex}, to include the requested answers and your name. Run {\LaTeX} on this file, and submit the resulting pdf file via Canvas.

{\bf You should not have to think long or hard about each question. It is acceptable to write down the first relevant thoughts that come to mind after reading the material. These thoughts will be the starting point for the class discussion. Your answer may be read out as part of the class discussion. Please write your answers independently, without collaborating with other students.

Each answer should be no more than three sentences, and one sentence may be sufficient. If the question is ambiguous, address what you think is the most relevant meaning that the question might have. Be alert for words that have a distinct and non-standard technical meaning in the context of RCRS (``interest'' is a good example).
